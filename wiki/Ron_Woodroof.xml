'''Ron Woodroof''' created what would become known as the Dallas Buyers Club in March 1988. Contracting HIV in the 1980s, he created the group as part of his efforts to find and distribute drugs to treat [[HIV]] at a time when the disease was poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biography.com/people/ron-woodroof-21329541#early-years&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; 

He sued the FDA over a ban on a drug he was using. &lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;http://www.npr.org/2013/11/01/242309799/the-dallas-cowboy-behind-the-real-buyers-club&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on September 12, 1992. &lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==

He had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that &quot;Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'&quot;. Woodroof later sent the doctor roses and the doctor took him back as a patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20131101-the-real-story-behind-the-dallas-buyers-club-movie.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his friends have told reporters he was gay or bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/06/ron-woodroof-gay-dallas-buyers-club_n_4740155.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/17/was_dallas_buyers_club_s_ron_woodroof_gay_or_bisexual_friends_and_doctor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts differ on whether he made homophobic comments. Reporter and screenwriter [[Craig Borten]] has said Woodroof was &quot;as racist and homophobic as they come&quot; while friends reportedly claim the opposite.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and afterward===

His life was the basis of the 2013 film ''[[The Dallas Buyers Club]].''

'''Ron Woodroof''' (born Texas, 1950 - died September 12, 1992) created what would become known as the Dallas Buyers Club in March 1988. Contracting HIV in the 1980s, he created the group as part of his efforts to find and distribute drugs to treat [[HIV]] at a time when the disease was poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biography.com/people/ron-woodroof-21329541#early-years&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; 

He sued the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] over a ban on a drug he was using. &lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;http://www.npr.org/2013/11/01/242309799/the-dallas-cowboy-behind-the-real-buyers-club&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on September 12, 1992. &lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==

He had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that &quot;Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'&quot;. Woodroof later sent the doctor roses and the doctor took him back as a patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20131101-the-real-story-behind-the-dallas-buyers-club-movie.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his friends have told reporters he was gay or bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/06/ron-woodroof-gay-dallas-buyers-club_n_4740155.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/17/was_dallas_buyers_club_s_ron_woodroof_gay_or_bisexual_friends_and_doctor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts differ on whether he made homophobic comments. Reporter and screenwriter [[Craig Borten]] has said Woodroof was &quot;as racist and homophobic as they come&quot; while friends reportedly claim the opposite.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and afterward===
&lt;!-- let's keep the information on the film to a minimum, since this article is supposed to be about the individual, not the movie --&gt;
His life was the basis of the 2013 film ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]].'' He was portrayed in the film by [[Matthew McConaughey]], who won many awards from his role including [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

==Biography==
Ron Woodroof was born in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on February 3, 1950&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas birth&quot;/&gt; to Garland Odell Woodroof (March 17, 1917 in Texas - December 3, 1983 in Dallas, Texas)&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland Woodroof&quot;/&gt; and Willie Mae Hughes (November 25, 1917 in [[Oklahoma]] - November 19, 1996 in Dallas, Texas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas death&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willie Woodroof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1940 US Census&quot;&gt;1940 United States Census: District 255-224, Family Number 207, Sheet Number and Letter 8A&lt;/ref&gt;

His first marriage was to Mary Etta Pybus on June 28, 1969 in Dallas, Texas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary marriage&quot;/&gt; and they had a daughter, Yvette Lynn Woodroof (born February 1, 1970 in Dallas, Texas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas birth&quot;/&gt; They divorced on March 23, 1972 in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary divorce&quot;/&gt; On May 6, 1972 he married Rory S.

He had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that &quot;Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'&quot; Woodroof later sent the doctor roses and the doctor took him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Sherry |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20131101-the-real-story-behind-the-dallas-buyers-club-movie.ece |title=The real story behind the ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ movie &amp;#124; Dallas Morning News |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts differ on whether he made homophobic comments. Reporter and screenwriter [[Craig Borten]] has said Woodroof was &quot;as racist and homophobic as they come&quot; while friends reportedly claim the opposite.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot; /&gt;

==Biography==
Ron Woodroof was born in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on February 3, 1950,&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas birth&quot;/&gt; to Garland Odell Woodroof (March 17, 1917, in Texas - December 3, 1983, in Dallas)&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland Woodroof&quot;/&gt; and Willie Mae Hughes (November 25, 1917, in [[Oklahoma]] - November 19, 1996, in Dallas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas death&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willie Woodroof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1940 US Census&quot;&gt;1940 United States Census: District 255-224, Family Number 207, Sheet Number and Letter 8A&lt;/ref&gt;

His first marriage was to Mary Etta Pybus on June 28, 1969, in Dallas;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary marriage&quot;/&gt; and they had a daughter Yvette Lynn Woodroof (born February 1, 1970).&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas birth&quot;/&gt; They divorced on March 23, 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary divorce&quot;/&gt; On May 6, 1972, he married Rory S.

He had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that &quot;Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'&quot; Woodroof later sent the doctor roses, and the doctor took him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Sherry |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20131101-the-real-story-behind-the-dallas-buyers-club-movie.ece |title=The real story behind the ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ movie &amp;#124; Dallas Morning News |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first marriage was to Mary Etta Pybus on June 28, 1969, in Dallas;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary marriage&quot;/&gt; and they had a daughter Yvette Lynn Woodroof (born February 1, 1970).&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas birth&quot;/&gt; They divorced on March 23, 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary divorce&quot;/&gt; On May 6, 1972, he married Rory S.

He had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that &quot;Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'&quot; Woodroof later sent the doctor roses, and the doctor took him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Sherry |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20131101-the-real-story-behind-the-dallas-buyers-club-movie.ece |title=The real story behind the ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ movie &amp;#124; Dallas Morning News |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts differ on whether he made [[homophobic]] comments. Reporter and screenwriter [[Craig Borten]] has said Woodroof was &quot;as [[racist]] and homophobic as they come&quot; while friends reportedly claim the opposite.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot; /&gt;

==Biography==
Woodroof was born in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on February 3, 1950,&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas birth&quot;/&gt; to Garland Odell Woodroof (March 17, 1917, in Texas - December 3, 1983, in Dallas)&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland Woodroof&quot;/&gt; and Willie Mae Hughes (November 25, 1917, in [[Oklahoma]] - November 19, 1996, in Dallas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas death&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willie Woodroof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1940 US Census&quot;&gt;1940 United States Census: District 255-224, Family Number 207, Sheet Number and Letter 8A&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that &quot;Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'&quot; Woodroof later sent the doctor roses, and the doctor took him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Sherry |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20131101-the-real-story-behind-the-dallas-buyers-club-movie.ece |title=The real story behind the ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ movie &amp;#124; Dallas Morning News |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts differ on whether he made [[homophobic]] comments. Reporter and screenwriter [[Craig Borten]] has said Woodroof was &quot;as [[racist]] and homophobic as they come&quot; while friends reportedly claim the opposite.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot; /&gt;
