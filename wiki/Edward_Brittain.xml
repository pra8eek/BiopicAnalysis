      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Brittain''' (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British soldier in World War I, memorialized by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in Testament of Youth.

Brittain was born at Newcastle-under-Lyme to paper manufacturer Thomas Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at Uppingham School, where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the Officer Training Corp.  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.</text>

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to New College, Oxford, but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the 10th Sherwood Foresters as a second lieutenant instead.  He served in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow and was devastated by the death of Roland Leighton in December 1915.  Early in 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front, where he was wounded in left arm and right thigh in the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916.  By an extraordinary coincidence, Brittain was sent to Number 1 London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his service on the Somme.  The notice in The Times stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack.  He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.</text>

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  He returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.

Brittain was sent to the Italian Alps with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918.

In June 1918, the British army read letters addressed to Edward Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with British soldiers in his company.  His commanding officer was notified that Brittain would be court-martialed when he came out of the line.  The commanding officer was also told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  The next day, 15 June 1918, Brittain was shot in the head during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  He evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but eventually told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933.  Brittain was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had either committed suicide or deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalized them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.''

His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but ironically, the siblings never managed to see each other in France.  Brittain was sent to the Italian Alps with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918.

In June 1918, the British army read letters addressed to Edward Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with British soldiers in his company.  His commanding officer was notified that Brittain would be court-martialed when he came out of the line.  The commanding officer was also told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  The next day, 15 June 1918, Brittain was shot in the head during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  He evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but eventually told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933.  Brittain was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had either committed suicide or deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalized them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Brittain''' (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British soldier in World War I, memorialized by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at Newcastle-under-Lyme to paper manufacturer Thomas Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the Officers' Training Corp.  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to New College, Oxford, but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters]] as a second lieutenant instead.  He served in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow and was devastated by the death of Roland Leighton in December 1915.  Early in 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front, where he was wounded in left arm and right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 1 July 1916.  By an extraordinary coincidence, Brittain was sent to Number 1 London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The notice in ''The Times'' stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack.  He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  During this period, the death of Geoffrey Thurlow in April 1917 and the blinding of Victor Richardson, also in April 1917, followed by his death in June 1917, transformed Brittain into--in his sister's words--&quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things . . .

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Brittain''' (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British soldier in World War I, memorialized by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at Newcastle-under-Lyme to paper manufacturer Thomas Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the Officers' Training Corp.  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to New College, Oxford, but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters]] as a second lieutenant instead.  He served in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow.  Roland Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was likewise posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 1 July 1916.  By an extraordinary coincidence, Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The notice in ''The Times'' stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack.  He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.   Geoffrey Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917;  Victor Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain into--in his sister's words--&quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things . . . Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt;   Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but ironically, the siblings never managed to see each other in France.  Brittain was sent to the Italian Alps with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918.

In June 1918, British army censors read letters addressed to Edward Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. Charles Hudson, was notified that Brittain would be court-martialed when he came out of the line.  Hudson was also told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  The next day, 15 June 1918, Brittain was shot in the head during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but eventually told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933.  Brittain was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had either committed suicide or deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalized them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Brittain's letters are published in Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge, eds., ''Letters from a Lost Generation: First World War Letters of Vera Brittain and Four Friends'' (Little, Brown, 1998).  His musical setting to his friend Roland Leighton's poem &quot;L'Envoi&quot; is published in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 78-80.

He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was likewise posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 1 July 1916.  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain into--in his sister's words--&quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things . . . Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt;   Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but ironically, the siblings never managed to see each other in France.  Brittain was sent to the Italian Alps with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918.

In June 1918, British army censors read letters addressed to Edward Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialed when he came out of the line.  Hudson was also told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  The next day, 15 June 1918, Brittain was shot in the head during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but eventually told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933.  Brittain was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had either committed suicide or deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Brittain's letters are published in Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge, eds., ''Letters from a Lost Generation: First World War Letters of Vera Brittain and Four Friends'' (Little, Brown, 1998).  His musical setting to his friend Leighton's poem &quot;L'Envoi&quot; is published in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 78-80.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British soldier in World War I, memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.

His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive.  

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British army officer in World War I, memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British army officer in World War I, memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British army officer in World War I, memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only surviving sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.  
[[File:Edward Brittain.jpg|thumb|Brittain's [[CWGC]] headstone in Granezza British Cemetery]]
Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].  

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 [[Bostridge]] published details of his discovery in ''Vera Bittain: A Life''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British army officer in World War I, memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only  sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.  
[[File:Edward Brittain.jpg|thumb|Brittain's [[CWGC]] headstone in Granezza British Cemetery]]
Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].  

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 [[Bostridge]] published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995) &lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Brittain is buried in Granezza British Cemetery in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/638748/BRITTAIN,%20EDWARD%20HAROLD CWGC entry]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1921 Vera Brittain visited the cemetery and her will requested that her ashes be scattered on his grave; &quot;for nearly 50 years much of my heart has been in that Italian village cemetery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Berry and Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'', 1995 (p. 523).&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter [[Shirley Williams]] honoured her request in September 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/poetsandprose/brittain.htm |title=Prose &amp; Poetry – Vera Brittain |accessdate=27 May 2008 |date=August 2001 |publisher=Firstworldwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Brittain's letters are published in Alan Bishop and [[Mark Bostridge]], eds., ''Letters from a Lost Generation: First World War Letters of Vera Brittain and Four Friends'' (Little, Brown, 1998).  His musical setting to his friend Leighton's poem &quot;L'Envoi&quot; is published in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 78-80.

In the 1979 television adaptation of [[Testament of Youth]] he was played by Rupert Fraser. In the Radio Four adaptation of ''Letters from a Lost Generation'' in 1998, Jonathan Firth took the role of Edward Brittain. In the 2014 [[Testament of Youth (film)|film of ''Testament of Youth'']] he was portrayed by [[Taron Egerton]].&lt;ref name=Taron-Colin-Alexandra&gt;{{cite news|last=Ge|first=Linda|title=Taron Egerton, Colin Morgan and Alexandra Roach Join Alicia Vikander in ‘Testament of Youth’|url=http://upandcomers.net/2014/02/13/testament-of-youth-taron-egerton-colin-morgan-alexandra-roach-alicia-vikander|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=upandcomers.net|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Toby's Room'', a novel by [[Pat Barker]], published in 2012, the fate of the central character of Toby is obviously based on that of Edward Brittain, though the source material is neither cited nor acknowledged.

He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].  

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 [[Bostridge]] published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995) &lt;/ref&gt;

In the Radio Four adaptation of ''Letters from a Lost Generation'' in 1998, Jonathan Firth took the role of Edward Brittain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895-15 June 1918) was a British army officer in World War I, memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only  sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.

On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 [[Bostridge]] published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a British army officer in [[World War I]], memorialised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only  sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the same front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a British army officer in [[World War I]], immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864-1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868-1948).  His only  sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the army and was commissioned  as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 10th [[Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the Western Front, died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the same front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died of wounds in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British army hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian army offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in [[World War I]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868&amp;ndash;1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the Sherwood Foresters 10th (Service) Battalion in England for the first year and a half of the war; during this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, [[Lieutenant colonel (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial and prison sentence.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in [[World War I]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868&amp;ndash;1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his Colonel who was not impressed by Edward's attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, [[Lieutenant colonel (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial, prison sentence, and the shame upon his family.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in [[World War I]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868&amp;ndash;1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his Colonel who was not impressed by Edward's attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, [[Lieutenant colonel (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial, prison sentence, and the shame it would inevitably bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities whilst at school at Uppingham.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Brittain's letters are published in ''Letters from a Lost Generation: First World War Letters of Vera Brittain and Four Friends'' (Little, Brown, 1998, Alan Bishop and [[Mark Bostridge]], eds.).  His musical setting to his friend Leighton's poem &quot;L'Envoi&quot; is published in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 78-80.

In the 1979 television adaptation of ''Testament of Youth'' he was played by Rupert Frazer. In the Radio Four adaptation of ''Letters from a Lost Generation'' in 1998, Jonathan Firth took the role of Edward Brittain. In the 2014 [[Testament of Youth (film)|film of ''Testament of Youth'']] he was portrayed by [[Taron Egerton]].&lt;ref name=Taron-Colin-Alexandra&gt;{{cite news|last=Ge|first=Linda|title=Taron Egerton, Colin Morgan and Alexandra Roach Join Alicia Vikander in ‘Testament of Youth’|url=http://upandcomers.net/2014/02/13/testament-of-youth-taron-egerton-colin-morgan-alexandra-roach-alicia-vikander|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=upandcomers.net|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Toby's Room]]'', a novel by [[Pat Barker]], published in 2012, the fate of the central character of Toby is based on that of Edward Brittain, though the source material is neither cited nor acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Barker, ''Toby's Room'' (Viking, 2012); Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in [[World War I]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

==Biography==
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868&amp;ndash;1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his Colonel who was not impressed by Edward's supercilious attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a V.A.D. nurse.  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, [[Lieutenant colonel (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial, prison sentence, and the shame it would inevitably bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities whilst at school at Uppingham.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in [[World War I]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

==Biography==
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868&amp;ndash;1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

Brittain left school in July 1914, just before World War I broke out.  He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities, he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=yes|startpage=9545|date=20 November 1914|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his Colonel who was not impressed by Edward's supercilious attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|V.A.D. nurse]].  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=yes|startpage=10176|date=20 October 1916|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]],'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917.  Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917.  These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed.  His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.  Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917.  He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company.  His commanding officer, [[Lieutenant colonel (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line.  Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway.  His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial, prison sentence, and the shame it would inevitably bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities whilst at school at Uppingham.  Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Edward Harold Brittain''', [[Military Cross|MC]] (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] officer who fought in the [[First World War]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

==Early life==
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864–1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868–1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

==First World War==
Brittain left school in July 1914, just before the First World War broke out. He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=y|page=9545|date=20 November 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his Colonel who was not impressed by Edward's supercilious attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front.  He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|V.A.D. nurse]].  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=y|page=10176|date=20 October 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]],'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917. Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917. These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth,'' 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed. His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war. Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917. He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company. His commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Edward Hudson|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line. Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway. His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way in order to avoid a court-martial, prison sentence, and the shame it would inevitably bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities while at school at Uppingham. Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Harold Brittain''', [[Military Cross|MC]] (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] officer who fought in the [[First World War]] and was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

==Early life==
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864–1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868–1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper making firm or the Civil Service.

==First World War==
Brittain left school in July 1914, just before the First World War broke out. He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=y|page=9545|date=20 November 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his Colonel who was not impressed by Edward's supercilious attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front. He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|V.A.D. nurse]].  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=y|page=10176|date=20 October 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]],'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'', (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917. Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917. These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'', 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed. His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war. Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917. He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company. His [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] (CO), Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Hudson (VC)|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line. Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway. His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way to avoid a court-martial, prison sentence, and the shame it would inevitably bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities while at school at Uppingham. Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger, but she eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate.'' While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of ''Letters from a Lost Generation'' in 1998, [[Jonathan Firth]] took the role of Edward Brittain.

'''Edward Harold Brittain''', [[Military Cross|MC]] (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] officer who was killed in the [[First World War]]; he was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

==Early life==
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864–1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868–1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper-making firm or the Civil Service.

==First World War==
Brittain left school in July 1914, just before the First World War broke out. He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=y|page=9545|date=20 November 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his colonel who was not impressed by Edward's supercilious attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front. He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|V.A.D. nurse]].  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=y|page=10176|date=20 October 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]],'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'', (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917. Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917. These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'', 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed. His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war. Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917. He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company. His [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Hudson (VC)|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line. Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway. His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way to avoid a [[court martial]] and the shame that these would inevitably bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities while at school at Uppingham. Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her of his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger but eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate''. While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Brittain's letters are published in ''Letters from a Lost Generation: First World War Letters of Vera Brittain and Four Friends'' (Little, Brown, 1998, Alan Bishop and [[Mark Bostridge]], eds.).

In the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of ''Letters from a Lost Generation'' in 1998, [[Jonathan Firth]] took the role of Edward Brittain. In the 2014 [[Testament of Youth (film)|film of ''Testament of Youth'']] he was portrayed by [[Taron Egerton]].&lt;ref name=Taron-Colin-Alexandra&gt;{{cite news|last=Ge|first=Linda|title=Taron Egerton, Colin Morgan and Alexandra Roach Join Alicia Vikander in 'Testament of Youth'|url=http://upandcomers.net/2014/02/13/testament-of-youth-taron-egerton-colin-morgan-alexandra-roach-alicia-vikander|accessdate=16 March 2014|publisher=upandcomers.net|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Harold Brittain''', [[Military Cross|MC]] (30 November 1895 – 15 June 1918) was a [[British Army]] officer who was killed in the [[First World War]]; he was immortalised by his sister [[Vera Brittain]] in ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

==Early life==
Brittain was born at [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire, to paper manufacturer Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864–1935) and his wife Edith Bervon Brittain (1868–1948).  His only sibling was his older sister Vera, to whom he was very close.  Brittain was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he made two close friends, [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]].  Brittain was a good student, though seldom a prizewinner, at Uppingham and also served in the [[Officers' Training Corps]].  A talented violinist, he hoped to become a composer, but his father expected him to enter either the family paper-making firm or the Civil Service.

==First World War==
Brittain left school in July 1914, just before the First World War broke out. He had been admitted to [[New College, Oxford]], but after the outbreak of hostilities he joined the British Army and was [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned]] as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Sherwood Foresters|Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]] on 19 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28981|supp=y|page=9545|date=20 November 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in England for the first year and a half of the war; he was held back from several transfers to the front by his colonel who was not impressed by Edward's supercilious attitude. During this period, he became close friends with fellow officer Geoffrey Thurlow. Leighton, who had been serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], died of wounds in December 1915, and soon afterwards, in early 1916, Brittain was posted to the Western Front. He was wounded in the left arm and the right thigh in the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[First day on the Somme|1 July 1916]].  Lieutenant Brittain was sent to First London General Hospital, where his sister was then working as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|V.A.D. nurse]].  He was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his service on the Somme.  The citation stated that Brittain was awarded the M.C. &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack. He was severely wounded, but continued to lead his men with great bravery and coolness until a second wound disabled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29793|supp=y|page=10176|date=20 October 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]],'' 21 October 1916, cited in Vera Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'', (New York: Penguin, 1989), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittain remained in England, recuperating and then on light duty, until 30 June 1917. Thurlow was killed in action at Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917; Richardson was blinded at Arras in April 1917, and died from a cerebral abscess in London in June 1917. These losses transformed Brittain, in his sister's words, into &quot;an unfamiliar, frightening Edward, who never smiled or spoke except about trivial things ... Silent, uncommunicative, thrust in upon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brittain, ''Testament of Youth'', 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Brittain returned to the Western Front almost exactly a year after he had left it and was immediately sent into battle, without knowing either the terrain or the men he was commanding, but emerged unscathed. His letters became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war. Vera Brittain was posted to a British hospital in northern France in August 1917, but the siblings never managed to see each other in France.

Brittain was sent to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] with the 11th Sherwood Foresters in November 1917. He saw his family for the last time on leave in January 1918. On 15 June 1918 on the [[Asiago]] Plateau, Captain Brittain was shot in the head and killed during an early morning counter-attack against an Austrian offensive, part of the [[Battle of the Piave River]].

In June 1918, army censors had read a letter from Brittain that indicated that he had had homosexual relations with men in his company. His [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Hudson (VC)|Charles Hudson]], was notified that Brittain would be court-martialled when he came out of the line. Hudson was told not to warn Brittain, but he warned him obliquely anyway. His commanding officer believed that Brittain put himself in harm's way to avoid a [[court martial]] and the shame that this would  bring upon his family. Edward's mother later revealed to Vera that Edward had been involved in homosexual activities while at Uppingham. Hudson evaded Vera Brittain's questions when she visited him in hospital in 1918, but told her of his suspicions after ''Testament of Youth'' was published in 1933. She was initially reluctant to believe that her brother had deliberately exposed himself to danger but eventually came around to his colonel's interpretation of events and fictionalised them in her novel ''Honourable Estate''. While researching the authorised biography of Vera Brittain, [[Mark Bostridge]] tracked down Hudson's son Miles and was permitted to read Hudson's account of Edward Brittain's last days. In 1995 Bostridge published details of his discovery in ''Vera Brittain: A Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014), Kindle edition; Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'' (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
